<p>To verify the effectiveness of the test patterns generated by this software a
number of experiments have been carried out, the results of which are shown
here. Broadly, these experiments are divided into two groups which demonstrate
that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The heuristic synthesis test pattern performs better than a naive test
pattern which assumes filter linearity.</p></li>
<li><p>The generated test patterns produce more extreme signal levels than real
pictures or noise signals in practice.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The software used to run these experiments <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bbc/vc2-signal-width-experiments/">can be found on GitHub</a>. The source of this
documentation page includes comments showing the exact command used to produce
each of the plots shown.</p>
<div class="section" id="heuristic-vs-naive-synthesis-test-patterns">
<h2>Heuristic vs naive synthesis test patterns<a class="headerlink" href="#heuristic-vs-naive-synthesis-test-patterns" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The heuristic developed in <a class="reference internal" href="test_patterns.html#theory-test-patterns"><span class="std std-ref">Test pattern generation</span></a> is designed to produce
more extreme signal values after quantisation than test patterns which ignore
non-linearities in VC-2. To verify this, the following experiment compares the
result of passing both types of synthesis test pattern through a VC-2 encoder
and decoder.</p>
<div class="section" id="method">
<h3>Method<a class="headerlink" href="#method" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The following procedure is carried out for each synthesis filter phase (i.e.
for each test pattern):</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Encode the pattern-under-test.</p></li>
<li><p>Quantise the transform coefficients produced in step 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Decode the quantised transform coefficients and record the signal value in
the targeted part of the synthesis transform.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 2-3 for all quantisation indices which don’t quantise all
transform coefficients to zero.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Quantisation is carried out using a single quantisation index for all picture
slices and using the default quantisation matrix for the filter configuration
used.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="results">
<h3>Results<a class="headerlink" href="#results" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The plot below shows the relative performance of the naive and heuristic test
patterns across all arrays and filter phases, broken down by transform depth
and wavelet. Each dot shows the relative performance of the test pattern for a
particular filter phase.</p>
<img alt="../_images/heuristic_improvement_all_phases.png" src="../_images/heuristic_improvement_all_phases.png" />
<p>In general, the heuristic test patterns produce signal levels at least one bit
larger than the naive test patterns, only rarely producing lower signal levels.
Occasional under-performance is to be expected since the heuristic is, well, a
heuristic.</p>
<p>The figure above treats each filter phase independently. In practice, most VC-2
implementations will choose a number of bits for each array as a whole rather
than using different numbers of bits for different phases. As the figure below
illustrates, the signal ranges for a given array can vary substantially between
filter phases:</p>
<img alt="../_images/filter_phase_test_pattern_variations.png" src="../_images/filter_phase_test_pattern_variations.png" />
<p>Because of this, it may make more sense to present the effect the heuristic
test patterns have on the worst-case signal levels within each array. The
plot is redrawn below but this time each dot represents the relative
improvement of going from the most extreme value produced by the naive
filter to the most extreme value for the heuristic filter for any phase.</p>
<img alt="../_images/heuristic_improvement_worst_case.png" src="../_images/heuristic_improvement_worst_case.png" />
<p>Overall, this tells us that for some filter arrays the test patterns produce
signal values one or more bits larger than the naive test patterns. Again, the
heuristic occasionally produces lower signal levels than the naive test pattern
though the effect is lessened when only worst-case phases are considered.</p>
<p>In summary we can conclude that the heuristic test patterns produce larger
signal levels than the naive test patterns in most cases.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="comparison-with-natural-images-and-noise">
<h2>Comparison with natural images and noise<a class="headerlink" href="#comparison-with-natural-images-and-noise" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As noted in <a class="reference internal" href="related_work.html#theory-related-work"><span class="std std-ref">Related work</span></a>, a common approach to picking signal
widths in wavelet transforms is to pass images or noise through the filter and
observe signal levels in practice. To measure the effectiveness of this
approach, an instrumented VC-2 encoder/decoder was used to log the signal
levels produced by noise signals, real pictures and the test patterns generated
by this software.</p>
<p>The plots below result from 4-level symmetric transforms using the VC-2 default
quantisation matrices.</p>
<div class="section" id="real-pictures-4-1-compression-ratio">
<h3>Real pictures, 4:1 compression ratio<a class="headerlink" href="#real-pictures-4-1-compression-ratio" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This first plot shows the peak signal levels produced by a collection of 48
natrual, 10-bit, luma-only, HD images, compressed at a ratio of 4:1, compared
with those produced by the heuristic test patterns.</p>
<img alt="../_images/luma_41_vs_test_patterns.png" src="../_images/luma_41_vs_test_patterns.png" />
<p>The plot above is broken up into several subplots which show the results for
different wavelet transform types.</p>
<p>Within a subplot, each column shows a histogram of the distribution of relative
signal values. From this plot we can immediately see that no picture ever
produces a signal level larger than the heuristic test patterns. In fact, in
the majority of pictures, real pictures produce peak signal levels one or more
bits lower than those produced by the test patterns. Some pictures produce
peaks over four bits lower than the test patterns for certain filter arrays.</p>
<p>From this plot we can conclude that bit-width requirements are likely to be
under-estimated by at least 1 bit for most wavelets if only real pictures are
used to determine bit-widths.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="saturated-noise-4-1-compression-ratio">
<h3>Saturated noise, 4:1 compression ratio<a class="headerlink" href="#saturated-noise-4-1-compression-ratio" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The other common test source for chosing bit widths is noise. The plot below
shows the peak signal levels achieved by 300 10-bit, HD, saturated, uniform
random noise pictures, compressed at a 4:1 ratio.</p>
<img alt="../_images/saturated_noise_41_vs_test_patterns.png" src="../_images/saturated_noise_41_vs_test_patterns.png" />
<p>This time, the peak signal levels of the noise signals more closely matches
that of the test patterns for early synthesis filter arrays. Deeper within the
transform, however, the test patterns begin to produce larger signal levels by
as many as two bits or more at the deepest parts of the transforms.</p>
<p>Under the two Deslauriers Dubuc wavelets, however, some noise signals peak
slightly above the test patterns in a small number of filter arrays. In
practice, however, the bit widths required to support the test patterns are
also sufficient for these peaks in this case. This is visualised by the
‘drawing pins’ in the plot.</p>
<p>The body of each ‘drawing pin’ shows the range of values which would be rounded
up to the same number of bits as the test pattern. In this case, we can see
that most of the noise overshoots are comfortably within this range. In the
more ambiguous cases, the colour of the pin head indicates whether any picture
actually exceeded the number of bits used by the test pattern. In this case all
of the pins are cyan indicating the test patterns indicated the correct number
of bits, even if the absolute signal range was a slight underestimate.</p>
<p>The main conclusions to be drawn from this graph is that the heuristic test
patterns also produce significantly higher signal levels than noise signals. In
particular, in deep parts of most transforms the signal levels are
under-estimated by over two bits – a worse under-estimate than produced by
real pictures.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="worst-case-quantisation">
<h3>Worst-case quantisation<a class="headerlink" href="#worst-case-quantisation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Both of the plots above show pictures compressed by a typical 4:1 compression
ratio. In practice, the most extreme signal levels are produced under larger
quantisation levels – and indeed the test patterns use much larger
quantisation levels.</p>
<p>The two plots below instead show the picture and noise signal levels at
whatever quantisation index makes them largest – i.e. worst-case quantisation.</p>
<img alt="../_images/luma_wc_vs_test_patterns.png" src="../_images/luma_wc_vs_test_patterns.png" />
<img alt="../_images/saturated_noise_wc_vs_test_patterns.png" src="../_images/saturated_noise_wc_vs_test_patterns.png" />
<p>In general the trends are essentially the same with both real pictures and
noise being likely to under estimate signal levels, particularly deeper in the
transform.</p>
<p>The most significant difference is that the Haar transform test patterns are
out-performed by both real pictures and noise in the final stages of the
synthesis filters. This shortcoming presents a possible motivation for using
<a class="reference internal" href="../cli/vc2_optimise_synthesis_test_patterns.html#vc2-optimise-synthesis-test-patterns"><span class="std std-ref">vc2-optimise-synthesis-test-patterns</span></a> to optimise test patterns for the
Haar transform.</p>

<h3>Detailed Results<a class="headerlink" href="#detailed-results" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Due to VC-2’s flexibility, the experiments carried out include a fairly large
number of variables. Many of these variables have little impact on the general
trends in the results. As a consequence, we begin by looking at specific
examples which demonstrate general trends before exploring the effects of
different codec configurations.</p>
<div class="section" id="general-trends">
<h4>General trends<a class="headerlink" href="#general-trends" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The plot below shows the worst-case signal levels in each array of a 4-level Le
Gall (5, 3) transform acting on 10 bit pictures.</p>
<img alt="../_images/bit_widths_noise_vs_pictures.png" src="../_images/bit_widths_noise_vs_pictures.png" />
<p>The ‘Theoretical upper bound’ line gives the upper-bound computed according to
affine arithmetic (see <a class="reference internal" href="aa_integer_arithmetic.html#theory-affine-arithmetic"><span class="std std-ref">Computing signal bounds with Affine Arithmetic</span></a>). The ‘Test pattern’
line shows the signal levels reached by the test patterns generated by this
software (see <a class="reference internal" href="test_patterns.html#theory-test-patterns"><span class="std std-ref">Test pattern generation</span></a>).</p>
<p>In the analysis filter, the test patterns almost exactly reach the theoretical
upper bound. In the synthesis filter, however, quantisation causes the
theoretical upper bounds to grow well beyond the level of the test patterns. In
all codec configurations, the synthesis filter’s theoretical upper bounds
appear to be significantly over-estimated (by several bits) compared with
signal levels observed in practice.</p>
<p>The ‘Saturated noise’ and ‘Real pictures’ lines show the signal levels reached
by saturated noise signals and real HD luma (Y) picture components
respectively. The lines show the mean peak signal across all pictures while the
error bars show the range. The results are shown for the quantisation index
which achieves an overall 4:1 compression ratio typical of VC-2 applications.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>In these experiments, the encoder encodes the entire picture as a single
picture slice using the lowest quantisation index which fits the required
picture data. This is a simplification of real encoder behaviour necessary
to keep the parameter space for these experiments under control.</p>
</div>
<p>A key result shown in this plot is that at every part of the analysis and
synthesis filters, the test patterns produce signal levels at least as large as
the pictures or noise. In many cases, the test patterns produce peak signal
levels over 1 bit larger than the pictures and noise. This means that had these
real pictures or noise been used to pick bit widths for a VC-2 implementation,
these would have under-estimated the required number of bits.</p>
<p>A secondary observation is that the ability of random noise signals to find
extreme signal levels reduces at deeper levels of the transform and also
following quantisation. In fact, this effect is so pronounced that at the
deepest part of the transform, real pictures actually produce more extreme
signal levels than the noise. This may be explained by these parts of the
transform being dominated by low-spatial-frequency content which natural
pictures are heavily skewed towards.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="effects-of-quantisation">
<h4>Effects of quantisation<a class="headerlink" href="#effects-of-quantisation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The previous plot showed the signal levels reached when real pictures and noise
are passed through a VC-2 codec using quantisation indices consistent with a
typical 4:1 compression ratio. By design, the quantisation levels required to
achieve this level of compression produce only small errors. At higher
quantisation levels, larger errors are produced which can lead to more extreme
signal values being produced from real picture and noise signals.</p>
<p>To illustrate the relative effects of atypical-quantisation levels, the plot
below compares the signal levels produced for 4:1 compressed pictures and noise
and ‘worst-case’ quantisations of those same pictures.  The ‘worst-case’ values
report the most extreme signal value produced at <em>any</em> quantisation index.</p>
<img alt="../_images/bit_widths_4to1_vs_worst_case_quantisation.png" src="../_images/bit_widths_4to1_vs_worst_case_quantisation.png" />
<p>As the plots show, worst-case quantisation produces consistently higher signal
levels than those found under 4:1 compression. Nevertheless, these signal
levels remain below the signal levels produced by the test patterns.</p>
<p>Once again, a 4-level Le Gall (5, 3) transform acting on 10 bit pictures is
shown above but the pattern is found to be consistent across other
configurations as is discussed in greater detail later.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The ‘worst-case’ quantisation levels used in the plot above are much higher
than those used under typical compression ratios. The boxplots below
illustrate the distributions of quantisation indices which are used in
practice.</p>
<img alt="../_images/quantisation_index_distributions.png" src="../_images/quantisation_index_distributions.png" />
<p>The ‘Test patterns’ boxplot shows the distribution of quantisation indices
used by the heuristic synthesis test patterns. The other box plots show the
actual distributions of quantisation indices used to encode the test
pictures and noise samples at various compression ratios.</p>
<p>The plots show that the quantisation levels used for real pictures at
typical (i.e. 4:1) or larger (6:1 and 8:1) compression ratios are
significantly lower than worst-case quantisation levels, and those levels
used by the test patterns. Even in the case of noise signals, the
quantisation levels used still fall short of these worst-case levels.</p>
<p>The plot specifically shows the quantisation indices used by a 4-level Le
Gall (5, 3) transform for 10 bit input signals however the general trend is
consistent accross configurations.</p>
</div>
<p>This result implies that even if encoders are deliberately configured to use
very large quantisation levels, real pictures and noise signals still do not
produce the signal levels produced by the heuristic test patterns.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="noise-types">
<h4>Noise types<a class="headerlink" href="#noise-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The plot below compares the signal levels achieved by non-saturated and
saturated noise signals, shown for worst-case quantisation indices. Again, a
4-level Le Gall (5, 3) transform is shown acting on 10 bit inputs.</p>
<img alt="../_images/bit_widths_saturated_vs_non_saturated_noise.png" src="../_images/bit_widths_saturated_vs_non_saturated_noise.png" />
<p>As might be expected, saturated noise results in higher worst-case signal
levels, a pattern found to be consistent across all arrays and all noise
samples and codec configurations tested. This confirms that saturated noise
makes a better test signal for finding extreme signal values than unsaturated
noise.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>A singular exception to the rule that saturated noise produces larger
signals than non-saturated noise was found in the experimental data.
Specifically the final output stage of the 2-level Haar (with shift)
synthesis transform, non-saturated noise produced worse-case signals around
0.2 bits larger than saturated noise. Due to the isolated incidence of this
rule, It is assumed that this outcome is the product of random chance and
that over a larger number of noise pictures, the rule would hold.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="picture-components">
<h4>Picture components<a class="headerlink" href="#picture-components" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The plot below compares the signal levels produced by different colour
components of the real picture signals. Again, a 4-level Le Gall (5, 3)
transform is shown acting on 10 bit inputs and 4:1 compression.</p>
<img alt="../_images/bit_widths_colour_components.png" src="../_images/bit_widths_colour_components.png" />
<p>As might be expected, the signal levels from the luma component (Y) in a YCbCr
picture and the components of an RGB picture are extremely similar. Likewise,
the colour difference signals (Cb and Cr) from a YCbCr picture show much lower
signal ranges due to relatively low signal levels encountered in typical
pictures. As a consequence, we only consider the luma component of real picture
signals in these experiments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="picture-size">
<h4>Picture size<a class="headerlink" href="#picture-size" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The plot below compares the signal levels produced by HD and UHD real
picture signals. Again, a 4-level Le Gall (5, 3) transform is shown acting on
10 bit inputs and 4:1 compression.</p>
<img alt="../_images/bit_widths_picture_size.png" src="../_images/bit_widths_picture_size.png" />
<p>The signal levels encountered at the different resolutions are broadly similar
with UHD signals producing slightly larger signal levels deeper in the
transform and slightly smaller signals nearer the start/end. Due to the
similarity of the signals produced by the two picture sizes, only HD signals
are shown in the other plots.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bit-depth">
<h4>Bit Depth<a class="headerlink" href="#bit-depth" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The plot below compares the signal levels produced by different picture bit
depths (on a relative scale). Again, a 4-level Le Gall (5, 3) transform is
shown with 4:1 compression.</p>
<img alt="../_images/bit_widths_bit_depth.png" src="../_images/bit_widths_bit_depth.png" />
<p>As shown, the results are essentially indistinguishable at every bit width,
though there are some occasional (small) differences which are assumed to be
due to differences in where quantisation boundaries fall. Since the impact on
bit widths on the overall trends in the results is extremely small, only 10 bit
examples are shown.</p>
