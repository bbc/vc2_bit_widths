``vc2_bit_widths``
==================

The :py:mod:`vc2_bit_widths` Python package provides routines for computing how
many bits of numerical precision are required for implementations of the SMPTE
ST 2042-1 `VC-2 professional video codec
<https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/vc-2>`_. In addition it also provides
routines for producing test pictures which produce large signal values in
actual video codecs.

To get started, you should read the :ref:`introduction` which explains the
purpose and terminology used by this tool and gives an overview of how the tool
should be used.
