SMPTE ST 2042-1 (VC-2) Bit Width Calculation Software
=====================================================

This Python package, `vc2_bit_widths`, provides routines computing how many
bits of numerical precision are required for implementations of the for the
SMPTE ST 2042-1 [VC-2 professional video
codec](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/vc-2).


Work in progress...
-------------------

This software is being produced as part of an effort to update the (currently
out-of-date) RP 2042-3 (VC-2 Conformance) document. When complete, these tools
and the associated document will allow codec implementers to verify the
conformance of their implementations with the SMPTE ST 2042-1 (VC-2) standard.

This software is currently a work in progress.  Contact [Jonathan
Heathcote](mailto:jonathan.heathcote@bbc.co.uk) or [John
Fletcher](mailto:john.fletcher@bbc.co.uk) for more information.
